# What is Sponsorware?
 Sponsorware is an approach to funding open source software initially implemented for [Sushi](https://github.com/calebporzio/sushi). 

Sponsorware projects are:
1) Open source
2) Released contingent on reaching a certain support threshold on a sponsorship platform (like [GitHub Sponsors](https://www.patreon.com/) or [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/))
